# üöÅ Open-ESPilot

**An open-source ESP32-based flight controller to bring the power of ArduPilot to *everyone*!**

Hi there, and welcome to **Open-ESPilot**! üéâ
This is a work-in-progress open hardware project to create a low-cost, hackable flight controller (FC) based on the mighty [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32). Whether you're a developer, hacker, drone enthusiast, or curious builder ‚Äî this is for you!

We're on a mission to make running [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/) more accessible on everyday hardware.

> üöÄ This project is part of [Hack Club‚Äôs *Highway to Hardware*](https://highway.hackclub.com/), a program that empowers students to build awesome electronics projects. Big thanks to them for their support!

---


## Why Open-ESPilot?
I wanted to take on the challenge of designing a **cheap, open-source, and hack-friendly flight controller** ‚Äî and share the journey with the community!

> To the best of my knowledge, this is the first-ever community-made ESP32-based flight controller built specifically for ArduPilot ‚Äî a true one-of-a-kind platform!

- A reference platform for running ArduPilot on ESP32
- A starting point for others to remix, improve, and explore
- Fully open-source, modular, and *actually fun* to tinker with


## Project Status
üîß **This project is in its early design & experimentation phase.** Nothing is final yet, and contributions or feedback are very welcome!  
I have finilized the PCB and going to send it to higway to get a grant to build it.

## Core Design Ideas üí°
- *Dev board meets flight controller* hybrid
- Ultra low cost ‚Äî 2-layer, single-sided PCB to keep it budget-friendly
- Readily available components
- Hackability so you can hack on your own features
    - Maybe modules?! (eg. ELRS, GPS)
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Designed with care by and for the community


### üõ†Ô∏è Planned Features
- [x] Basic schematic and PCB layout
- [x] Selection of components is decided in [Issues](https://github.com/Tomas-Kuchta-FPV/Open-ESPilot/issues)
- [ ] Compare BOM cost to commercial FCs - going to figure it out when I have time.
- [ ] Complete code, documentation and build guide


## Design Phases
1. **Planning & goal setting**‚úÖ
2. **Schematic design**‚úÖ
    - Start with core ESP32 + power
    - Add sensors and outputs
    - Evaluate BOM & gather feedback
3. **Community feedback loop**‚úÖ
4. **PCB layout**‚úÖ
5. **Prototype ordering**
6. **‚Ä¶And hopefully it works on the first try! ü§û**


## Firmware
This flight controller is built to run the [ESP32 port of ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/esp32-autopilot.html) ‚Äî a massive shoutout to the incredible developers and contributors who made this possible! 
> This project wouldn‚Äôt exist without them ‚Äî go show them some love!

## My background
I previously built a basic ESP32-based FC that worked ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt as polished as dedicated hardware. After testing with the SpeedyBee F405 Wing APP for an ArduPilot Rover, I had the idea to make a more focused and community-driven board.


## Built With
- [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) ‚Äì the core micro controller
- [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) ‚Äì for PCB design
- [ArduPilot](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot) ‚Äì the autopilot software we're building for
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Open source tools and community support
- ... and Love ‚ù§Ô∏è
