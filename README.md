# Open-ESPilot

**An open-source ESP32-based flight controller designed to bring ArduPilot to more people.**

I welcome you to Open-ESPilot repo! This is a work-in-progress project to create a simple, open hardware flight controller (FC) based on the ESP32. It's being built with the goal of making it easier and cheaper to run [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/) on accessible hardware ‚Äî whether you're a developer, hacker, or just someone who loves robots and drones.

This project is being developed as part of [Hack Club‚Äôs *Highway to Hardware*](https://highway.hackclub.com/) program üöÄ Many thanks to them!


## Why this exists

Most flight controllers out there are expensive, closed-source, or hard to modify. At the same time, ArduPilot is one of the most powerful autopilot stacks out there, and the ESP32 is a super capable, low-cost microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi that can be used for MAVlink.

So... why not bring them together?

The goal is to make a board that:

-  Create a reference platform for ArduPilot on ESP32.
-  Make it easy and affordable to build or buy.
-  Keep it fully open-source, modular, and easy to hack.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Status

I previously built a basic ESP32-based FC that worked ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt as polished as dedicated hardware. After testing with the SpeedyBee F405 Wing APP for an ArduPilot Rover, I had the idea to make a more focused and community-driven board under *Highway to Hardware*.

üîß **This project is in its early design & experimentation phase.** Nothing is final yet, and contributions or feedback are very welcome!


### Core Design Ideas üí°

- Single PCB (stacked boards likely unnecessary)
- Modular thinking: support for swappable or optional components (ELRS, ESCs, etc.)
- Needs to be **inexpensive** but flexible ‚Äî if it‚Äôs pricier than commercial options, it should offer something unique or valuable
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Designed with care by and for the community

### üõ†Ô∏è Planned Features

- [ ] Basic schematic and PCB layout

- [ ] The component selection is decided in [Issues](https://github.com/Tomas-Kuchta-FPV/Open-ESPilot/issues)

- [ ] Compare BOM cost to commercial FCs

- [ ] Complete documentation and build guide
- [ ] 3D-printable case/enclosure


## Design Phases

1. **Planning & goal setting**
2. **Schematic design**
    - Start with core ESP32 + power
    - Add sensors and outputs
    - Evaluate BOM & gather feedback
3. **Community feedback loop**
4. **PCB layout**
5. **Prototype ordering**
6. **‚Ä¶And hopefully it works on the first try! ü§û**
