## Written README.md - 21.6.2025  
Like every begining of a Open Source project I create a GitHub repo and write a readme to let people know on what I'm working on.

**Time spent: 1h**

## Goal setting and asking for help and interest in the ardupilot comunity. - 26.6.2025  
I have written out a list of things I would need help with. And did simple goal setting to see if people like my idea.  
Then written a message and posted it on [ardupilot discussion forum.](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/help-me-build-the-first-open-source-esp32-flight-controller-for-makers/135974)  
Also I wanted to ask the devs on the Discord channel so I have also messaged them.  
I'm thankful for any help from the community as I have some perception but community needs can be other. When workng together we can make useful things for more people!

I have created Issues for each goal in this repo to keep ideas in one place.  
After that I have created issues for thing that needs to be decided on.  
I'm sharing my notes for the message in [asking for help and interest in the ardupilot comunity.md](https://github.com/Tomas-Kuchta-FPV/Open-ESPilot/blob/41703091e80cd6ef6a6719e9a7e344e687c4ec42/asking%20for%20help%20and%20interest%20in%20the%20ardupilot%20comunity.md)

## Talked with DavidBuzz and asked for help, laid ground work for ESP32S3 core schematic and Pin definitions. - 28.6.2025  
I have read a lot of great responses to the message. Thank everyone for support.

We have decided on a form factor of a plane FC. Because this is my First FC and I didn't want to complicate it.  
David had an interesting idea to make it 30x30 Drone form factor. But that would need a two sided components and more than 4 layers. So that will hopefully be project for another day. I love this idea.

This sparked an idea of the first design constraints, which are Inexpensiveness, availability and hackability(flexibility)!

With the help of David we have decided on a MCU [ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/WiFi-Modules_Espressif-Systems-ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8_C2913198.html?s_z=n_ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8).  
We think that you should be able to fit the AP code on 4mb flash but this project is aimed at more of a Dev board/Flight Controller hybrid so we were thinking of either 16mb or 8mb flash and no PSRAM as it isn't needed. And the 8mb hit that sweet spot of price and developer needs.  
He has also pointed me to his [pin definition](https://github.com/davidbuzz/ardupilot/blob/esp32s3-buzz-combined-sept-11th/libraries/AP_HAL_ESP32/README.esp32s3-pin-selection-hints.txt). And I have compiled the definitions into a spreadsheet.

He said that I completly forgot the SD card. So I have opened an issue for it.

Also I have deleted my work so I needed to recover it. ü§¶ - Commit 6e2a837

Then I have edited the README.md to reflect the design constraints. To let everyone know about what is this project!

## Finished the ESP32S3 and its peripherals and Finished Power side of things. - 30.6.2025  
I started by researching how to implement the ESP32-S3 WROOM module. Since I‚Äôve previously worked with the ESP32-C3, I already have some background knowledge.  
During this phase, I also learned about KiCad buses and hierarchical schematic design.

I have made the schematic with the MP1584 IC because I thought there are modules based on this IC but after desoldering the chip. It didn't really look like the correct footprint so I have deleted it because it would be too much work. ... I've said after I have made a schematic symbol and implemented it to the schematic with its components.

So I have decided to use the *Clone "MP1584" module* thats at least how do I call them. Because this way its way easier and probably cheaper as I would either need to either desolder the chip from the board or buy it separately. So Module will help a lot in terms of cost and simplicity.

So after all of that I have created another set of schematic symbol and footprint. This took tooooo looooong. At least it's done.

And made the schematic prettier. :]

## Added Schematic and footprint of the GY-91 IMU and implemented it to the schematic. - 1.7.2025  
Today I haven't much time to work on this project so I had Just one goal of implementing IMU which is the GY-91 module.  
Its Going to be used as a module on the board because I'm implying same philosophy as for the *Clone "MP1584" module*.

I always like the schematic symbol creation in KiCAD. But creating the footprint is much more frustrating as I can't use normal CAD tools to constrain the footprint. I would love to make footprints in FreeCAD, maybe there is a better worflow?

**Time spent: 3h**

**Check if the footprint is correct using a paper representation. - 3.7.2025**  
Today I haven't had much time so I only checked if the footprints I've made are correct by printing them on paper.  
But when exporting I've noticed that I forgor the front silkscreen. So this should be corrected when I have time.  
After printing the first sheet it printed in portrait and it was shrinked.  
Then I printed it in landscape and after confirming with calipers it was shrieked a little which didn't matter. Aleast I can check the proportions which seemed to be correct.

After checking everything seemed to be OK except for the F. Silkscreen.

## Assigned pins to the ESP pins and tested it by compiling adupilot code. - 7.7.2025  
After reading a lot of documentation and Davids Pin definition I have created a LibreOffice Calc sheet to write my notes and GPIO pin assigments.  
I have learned that the pins for the [sd card in mmc mode can't be reassigned](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/eeb72ce9622dbe6a5dda6ae1cb8352c0c00750f9/libraries/AP_HAL_ESP32/SdCard.cpp#L96C5-L117C7).
[And the SPI3 controller can bypass GPIO Matrix to improve preformance.](https://github.com/davidbuzz/ardupilot/blob/8875cd8d980312bfe78d42909fcda2e10fdb5c46/libraries/AP_HAL_ESP32/README.esp32s3-pin-selection-hints.txt#L24C1-L44C99) As of now I don't think is implemented in ardupilot code. One issue I see is that the GPIO pins are all over the place and the routing will be more difficult.  
So I kept these in mind and worked around them. 

### Compiling Ardupilot  
For now I just assigned pins to the important Devices.  
I have tested the ardupilot port to the ESP32 platform in the past. I was using the ESP32 with a GY-91 IMU. For that I have prepared a podman container.  
I'm sharing the secret sauce in [Ardupilot_DEV_Container.md](https://github.com/Tomas-Kuchta-FPV/Open-ESPilot/blob/main/Ardupilot_DEV_Container.md)  
So I have compiledd and tested the esp32s3empty board definition and it worked! Although I haven't seen anythyng on the PWM outputs which is probably fine right? Then I have tested an ibus protocol. There was a error `E rmt(legacy): RMT RX BUFFER FULL`. [And in esp32empty there was a coment on that.](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/eeb72ce9622dbe6a5dda6ae1cb8352c0c00750f9/libraries/AP_HAL_ESP32/boards/esp32empty.h#L83) I can't bother with code now as I don't have too much time as we go 12. in a mountain cabbin and I want to be offline and present in the moment. :)  

Thing I have probed with a scope
 - IMU comunication ‚òë
 - I2C ‚òë
 - MMC SD card ‚òë
 - PWM outputs êÑÇ - This is weird but I think the problem is on my side.

### Assigning Pins  
After that I have thought on how to assign the GPIOs because I need to think about if I can route the PCB and if I can even use the pins I choose.  
Luckily I'm working with an ESP32 platform which has the mentioned GPIO matrix that makes the assigment a whole lot easier as I can switch some pins for one and the other when routing the PCB. After almost completing the assigment I had a briliant idea to color code the GPIOs so I know which side is which.  
During the design I've referenced the [ESP32-S3-WROOM-1](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf) datasheet. So I know if the pins I choose are one next to each other.  

I now can tell you why I have assigned the pins this way.  
| Component  | Decision                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GY-91      | Pin specific if bypasing GPIO matrix. So with Davids recomendation we choose these pins.         |
| SD card    | If using the faster SD MMC mode the pins are assigned to specific pins.                          |
| PWM output | It needed to be unsplit and to be on a convinient side of the module so I choose the right side. |

 - The other periphelials were chosen as it fit. The main consideration was for the pins that needed to be together.

Then I have created a sketch of the board layout. I'm using the kicad color scheme to know how much will the traces cross.

Also there is the spreadsheet:

**Time spent: 8h**

## Added peripheral to the schematic. - 12.7.2025  
After assigning the pins I need to add peripherals to the shematic. Which is pretty easy as I already have assigned pins in a spreadsheet.  
I'm working on this on a family trip in Krkono≈°e mountains in my free time. Thats why this part took me a long time.  
I have referenced the ardupilot on ESP32 documentation and a generic f405 wing FC. So that the pinouts are common.  

  - I have started with checking if the MCU is correct.  
  - Then I went on the PWM out and RC in.  
    - I have used a common pinout for the PWM connector.  
    - After that I have Added the RC in connector with an invertor for SBUS.  
  - UARTs are next.  
    - For the GPS I just used a common pinout thats used for M10 GPS.  
    - And the ELRS I just used a generic f405 wing for the pinout.  
  - For I2C I just used the pinout from ardupilot on ESP32.  
  - RGB LED and the BUZZER was pretty easy as for the buzzer I just used a simple tranzistor switch.  
  - As for the micro SD card I have no clue as I didn't worked with SD cards.  
    - So I just used the recemonded pins.  
  - Then I have thought and implemented Voltage and Current measurement tracked in [issues #6](https://github.com/Tomas-Kuchta-FPV/Open-ESPilot/issues/6).  
    - Voltage is pretty simple as I can just use a voltage devider and read the scaled voltage.  
    - But for Current I have a few options like:  
      - Shunt Resistor + Amplifier  
        - OP amp  
        - INA219 - Current/Power Monitor With I2C Interface  
        - INA181 - Current-Sense Amplifier  
      - Hall Effect Sensors  
    - So I have opted for a voltage devided and a INA219 IC.  
    - The INA219 isn't implemented in ardupilot on ESP32 yet so thats why there is also retundant voltage divider. The INA219 circuit can be left out.

## Fixing mistakes in my Schematic - 16.7.2025  
I have pretified and clarified the ROOT schematic. And wired it using hirarchical pins. I don't know whats better for clarity. I'm thinking either hirarchical pins or global labels.  
I've also made a voltage selector with a p-mosfet and a retundant 3 pin header to select either the regulator or the USB-C.

After that I've checked with Electrical Rules Checker. And it showed a lot of errors and warnings.  
![ERC](https://github.com/Tomas-Kuchta-FPV/Open-ESPilot/blob/main/Journal%20Images/ERC.png)  
One of those thing was that I've added two net labels to one wire as I want to label the gpio and function.  
Also some Power pins errors.  
OOOH it was just because the libraries wasn't loaded. Now its just 10 errors and 22 warnings. nice ;)  

Then I went on making the schematic better.  
Things edited:  
 - Added a resistor for a bridged solder jumper on the double net labels wires to separate nets and make the traces easily separable.  
 - Added GPIO termination pins  
 - Added more Capacitors  
 - Added ESD protection on +5V line  
 - Added a polyfuse and reverse voltage protection diode  
 - Added a zener diode to ADC voltage measurement  
 - Added a second LDO - to test a smaller LDO  
 - Renamed the Clone `"MP1584" module` to `Clone _MP1584_ module` as it caused some issues  
 - And also running the voltages to and from on the root schematic insted of in global power symbols  

After procrastinating I have to fix the other errors I have with the schematic.  
OH now there are just errors that arent as severe. nice

## Assigning footprints and compents to schematic symbols. - 19.-30.7.2025  
When fixing issues with my schematic in the process of adding jumpers I have already decided on footprints.  
So everything else remains.  
I haven't thought about the footprints and components a lot.  
So the first obvious ones are resistors and capacitors. Keeping with the project theme (Inexpensiveness, availability and hackability) I choose the 0805 SMD size as it can be easily soldered and you can go to a smaller size like 0402 which still fits on the pads.  
I have referenced my other project called TwinkleTron for footprints and componets. For example the USB-C, Buttons, smaller SOT-89-3 LDO. And replicated my 5V Selector as I have worked on multiplexing voltage before. There is no need to reinvent the wheel.  

After that I have removed the polyfuse from the vin to the regulator. And now I have 5V protected and unprotected with the polyfuse.  
Then I have removed the polyfuse entirely as I couldn't find the right fuse.

And back to the main task. 
For the breakout I have decided to have a pin header compatible plated hole.  
The buzzer I choose a common `TMB12A05` buzzer that has diameter of 12mm and pitch of 7.6mm.  
For the micro SD card I went with `DM3AT-SF-PEJM5` that was already in KiCAD and I have looked on LCSC and there weren't any better options.  
And the Gold Caps I choose 1000uF leaded for the input. And 1000uF SMD for the 5Vc rail as I expect a lot of noise there from the servos. So I have added a cap to the servos and to peripheals. Also I have noticed that i forgot decoupling caps.  

Now I need to assign three things the shunt resistor, the power solder pads and decoupling caps.  
For the solder pads I got inspired from the SB f405 WING APP FC and decided on long rectangular pad insted of sqare one from Matek.  
As in KiCAD there isn't a footprint that would fit I need to make one. It was pretty straight foward.  
I choose the pad size and I wanted to have one side with rounded edges so I've choose chamfered with other corners rounded and the chamfer size as small at it can be and corner size on 50%. Also chose the corners to "chamfer".  
For the decoupling caps I choose common 100nF and 22uF MLCCs. (I like the name;)  
AS for the shunt resistor I need to read the `INA219`s documentation a little more.  
I have asked claude to choose the [Shunt resistor](https://claude.ai/share/db22d6e2-1d00-4bdb-a14f-e951676a770c) because I donn't have any experience with shunts. I have thought to use either a 1mR or 0.5mR one. The 0.5mR seems better.  
Also because the FC is qite mission critical I've added a ferrite bead to the ESP32S3 to hopefully filter noise out. Maybe it would be beneficial to have more than one regulator.  

After all of that I check ERC and don't see any error. yay :)  
So that means that the schematic is complete!  

Now I need to route the PCB. Also I need to notify the comunity that the schematic is finished!

## PCB routing and small fixes - 24.7.2025
After checking the schematic I noticed that I forgot to decide on the Voltage divider.  
And I want to reanotate the schematic, so that the components references makes sense.  

Now for the Routing.  
![Routing Start](https://github.com/Tomas-Kuchta-FPV/Open-ESPilot/blob/main/Journal%20Images/Routing_Start.png)  
The first thing that I do is to arange the components into function groups and things that should be together.  
![PCB Aranged into groups](https://github.com/Tomas-Kuchta-FPV/Open-ESPilot/blob/main/Journal%20Images/PCB_Aranged_into_groups.png)  

Then I went on the power input and measurement.  
Then I have noticed that everything is off-grid so I have manualy entered a rounded up value. But I can't do this to everything grouped so I have decided to remove the components and add them via Updating PCB and with 1mm grid. I will use a 0.1mm grid for everything from now on.  
For now I have put these components to the side as I think a better workflow would be to select the components in schematic and move them in place.  
![Messed Up Grid](https://github.com/Tomas-Kuchta-FPV/Open-ESPilot/blob/main/Journal%20Images/Messed_Up_Grid.png)  

I have pulled up my layout sketch for reference.  
First thing I worked on is the Power stage as it seemed logical to start from the power input.  
This project also reminds me of my TwinkleTron project which has almost the same layout. 
 - I have aranged the power pads and added coper fill to them to make them electricaly connected. Also a lot of current is going to pass thru those.  
 - Then I've Added the shunt with copper fill and the INA219.  


After that I brought the ESP on top as in my sketch. Because I need to know were the things are going to be roughly positioned. Also added the CC resistors to the USB-C plug. And positioned it to the left side of the ESP.  

Then I went on the PWM output and RC input.  
 - I firstly aligned the PWM headers using the grid. And then merged them.  
 - Under that I routed the RC in header with a invertor.  
After puting them into the top most right corner I noticed that I need to sqeeze in a debug UART headder. So I moved the PWM down.  

The LED, USB-C and buzzer were pretty straight foward.  
 - For the USB-C I just routed the data+/- lines as I already placed the CC resistors.  
 - The LED has just a decouling cap and DIO Headder positioned near the edge of the board.  

Along the way I fixed a few small errors in my schematic.  

**Time spent: 6h**

## PCB routing and small schematic fixes - 26.7.2025
**Its the 26th of July and we are now in ≈†umava moutains. And I need to finish this project.**  
I've placed the smaller LDO on the front and the bigger one on the back just under the 5V regulator.  
And the voltage measurement on top also on the opposite side of the regulator.  
When working on the PCB I usually notice a few errors and I finalyse some things.  
Like the SD card breakout. The pin headder wouldn't fit and if I stuck with it that would create a lot of issues. So I plan on using the jumpers if I need to check something and I added SMD solder pads to unused pins.  
I saw a space on the right for the UART headers and also the I2C headder.  
After that I've worked on bringing the two sides closer. One being the MCU side and the other on were the power pins.  

Right now I have the local traces routed and the longer traces need to be routed on the back layer.  
Time to finish this project is running short. - its 28.7. And I need to finish it and upload it. All while not having a super relible internet connection.  
If I want internet I neet to go to the local mountain top to get cell connection.  
Then I went on routing the long traces that need to go from one side to the other. Like the Power, I2C, UARTS and Voltage measurement.  
I'm in rush to finish this so I have taken a few shortcuts. Like traces that doesn't run on the same side, traces between headders.  
Maybe I should add a RC filter to the ADC-Voltage.  
To late now.  

And I'm omiting naming the headers as this is supossed to be a early prototype.  
But it should work!  
Only thing remaining is to test the finished board.

## Finishing documentation and submiting to highway - 30.7.2025
I need to read on how to submit and whats needed. For that I need to visit a place with cell reception as I don't have any internet here.  

I love the highway to hardware only thing is that I would love for the deadline to be mid August as my July is packed. Or I would like to see something like this in the school year.  

I have the README.md describing the project and its goals. And my motivation.  
I've assigned LCSC numbers to parts and made the BOM table in README.md.  
And prepared the README.md for submiting to highway.  
Screenshoted the PCB and added it to RADME.md.  

**Time spent: 4h** - not couting it in total time spent.

## Preparing to order
Yesterday I received the HackClub grant I was the last to be reviewed. And I wasn't shure if I'm going to be accepted.  
Thank a lot for making many student lives better!  

I reviewed it before sending it to be fabricated.  
And I noticed a few things like Headers should be labeled. Apart from that I didn't need to do anything.  
For that I needed to move jumpers and label the ELRS/I2C/GPS Connector.  
When I'm at it I also labeled other things and added cute graphics.  

You may be wondering why did I need to change the connector? It just may be because I was rushing this part. :)  
I thankfully have time now.  

Tomorrow I will order everything.
