**Total Time Spent: x** <!-- Going to figure it out when I'm done-->

## Written README.md
Like every begining of a Open Source project I create a GitHub repo and write a readme to let people know on what I'm working on

**Time spent: 1.5h**

## Goal setting and asking for help and interest in the ardupilot comunity
I have written out a list of things I would need help with. Then writen a message and posted it on [ardupilot discussion forum.](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/help-me-build-the-first-open-source-esp32-flight-controller-for-makers/135974)

Also I wanted to ask the devs on the Discord channel so I also written a message to them.

I'm thankfull for any help from the comunity as I have some perception but comunity needs can be other. When workng together we can make usefull things for more people!

I have created Issues for each goal in this repo to keep ideas in one place.

I'm sharing my notes in [asking for help and interest in the ardupilot comunity.md](https://github.com/Tomas-Kuchta-FPV/Open-ESPilot/blob/41703091e80cd6ef6a6719e9a7e344e687c4ec42/asking%20for%20help%20and%20interest%20in%20the%20ardupilot%20comunity.md)
